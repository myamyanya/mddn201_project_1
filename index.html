            <h1>Seeing Networks in Wellington</h1>
            <P>Wellington, as the capital city of New Zealand, has the perfect network system. People living in this small but beautiful city enjoy their comfortable life with Internet. </P>
            <p>At the same time that people using the Internet, the transmission of networks relies on the Internet infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the <a href="http://seeingnetworks.in/nyc/"><em>Seeing Networks in New York City</em></a>, and based on the field resaerch, some Internet infrastructure in Wellington will be briefly introduced. </p>

				<h3>Traffic Cameras</h3>
				<p>These <em>traffic cameras</em> are usually set at the intersections in Wellington to catch the overspeed vehicles. The principle they working on is that the sensors under the road will be actived when the vehicle start to move and send a signal to the camera to take a photo. Then, when the vehicle past the road, the sensor will send a signal to the camera again. The two photos and time will be record in the system and calculated to judge if this vehicle is overspeed. </p>
                <p>In general, traffic cameras are connected to the police network. </p>

				<h3>Satellite Antenna</h3>
				<p>The <em>satellite antenna</em>, also named as satellite dish, is designed to receive or transmit information by radio waves to or from a communication satellite. At the same time of receiving signals, it will remove as much noise as it could. After collected the signals, the satellite receiver will demodulate the signal and transmit it to modem so that users could connect to the network.</p>

				<h3>Manhole Covers</h3>
				<p><em>Manholes</em> are holes on the surface of roads that used to examine underground pipes and wires. Usually, there are many differnt wires set underground together. For example, open a manhole, may find the electric wires, telephone wires, network wires, etc.</p>
                <p>Setting the wires underground could save more space that above the ground. Also, differnt companies has differnt manhole covers, which is more convenient to examine.</p>

                <h1>Indoor Internet infrastructure in Wellington</h1>
                <p>Various of the indoor infrastructure may be more familiar to people. Using access and cables is the traditional way to connet to the Internet. Besides, there is a lot of infrastructure used to transmit or recieve wireless signals. </p>

				<h3>Access and Cable</h3>
				<p><em>Accesses and cables</em> could transmit digital signals.</p>
                <p>Generally, a single cable has eight wires inside, four of them transmit signals and another four are backup wires. These eight wires are paint in differnt colours so that the user could easily distinguish them.</p>

				<h3>Router</h3>
				<p>Routing is the process of forwarding IP packets from one network to another. A <em>router</em> is a device that joins networks together and routes traffic between them. For the wireless router, it could transmit wireless signals. That is why people could connect to WIFI by using laptops or cell phones.</p>

				<h3>Wireless Range Extender</h3>
				<p>The <em>wireless range extender</em> aims to improve WIFI coverage.</p>
                <p>A WiFi Repeater effectively contains two wireless routers, similar to the wireless router you already have in your home or office. One of these wireless routers picks up the existing WiFi network. It then transfers the signal to the other wireless router, which transmits the boosted signal.</p>
